# EDGE-to-Edge

## Description

Duration: Two week build

MN gets snow as part of its four seasons and as there is snow, there are those who enjoy riding on top of it. This application was created to gather people who enjoy going out to their local ski resort, without the hassel of having to coordinate to get individuals together. Your friends will be able to see your information and status and hopefully it will motivate them to meet you at the slopes.
